# Janet–Zig interoperation rules

The Phase 2 code uses the following rules until the relevant runtime
subsystems move to Zig:

- Janet owns all Janet values and managed allocations. Zig does not reproduce
  the allocator or garbage collector.
- A Janet value held across a call that may allocate must be visible to the
  collector. The interop test uses `janet_gcroot` and `janet_gcunroot`
  explicitly around a forced collection.
- A Janet `setjmp`/`longjmp` signal must never cross an active Zig frame.
- Janet callbacks therefore enter through a C trampoline. Zig returns success
  or failure and an out-parameter normally; only after Zig has returned may
  the trampoline call `janet_panicv`.
- Potentially panicking allocation sequences called on Zig's behalf are
  enclosed by `janet_try` in a C helper. Any non-local jump lands inside that
  helper and becomes an ordinary `JanetSignal` before control returns to Zig.
- Zig invokes Janet functions with `janet_pcall`, not `janet_call`, so callback
  signals are resolved in C and returned explicitly.
- Zig exports use the C calling convention and C-compatible parameter types.
  `Janet` values cross Zig export boundaries through pointers/out-parameters;
  C-facing Janet callbacks remain thin C functions returning `Janet` by value.
- Zig errors and panics never cross the C ABI. Expected Janet failures use the
  explicit status-and-payload path; unexpected Zig failures are contained by
  functions that do not expose an error union.
- The simple Zig REPL reader allocates line memory with Zig's C allocator and
  transfers it to the C trampoline, which frees it after copying into a Janet
  buffer.

The C bridge is intentionally small. Later subsystem ports should reuse this
pattern until Janet's signal mechanism is replaced with explicit internal
control flow.
